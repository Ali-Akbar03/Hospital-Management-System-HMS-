🏥 Hospital Management System (Java Console App)

📋 Description
This is a simple console-based Hospital Management System built using Java. It demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like:
1.Abstraction (Person as an abstract class)
2.Inheritance (Patient extends Person)
3.Encapsulation (private fields with public getters/setters)
4.Polymorphism (method overriding and overloading)
5.The system allows hospital staff to add, view, search, and delete patient records.

🛠 Features
1.Add new patients with ID, name, age, and disease information.
2.View a list of all patients.
3.Search for a patient by ID.
4.Delete a patient record by ID.
5.Console-based interactive menu.

🧱 Code Structure
1.Person (abstract class): General blueprint for a person with name and age.
2.Patient (class): Extends Person, includes id and disease attributes.
3.HospitalManagementSystem (main class): Handles user interaction and operations on the patient list.
