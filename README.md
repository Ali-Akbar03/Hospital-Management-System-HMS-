🏥 Hospital Management System (Java Console App)
📋 Overview
This is a simple console-based Hospital Management System developed in Java. The application demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and allows hospital staff to efficiently manage patient records.

💡 OOP Concepts Implemented
•	Abstraction: Person is an abstract class.
•	Inheritance: Patient class extends Person.
•	Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters and setters.
•	Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding are used.
