🏥 Hospital Management System (Java Console App)
📋 Overview
This is a simple console-based Hospital Management System developed in Java. The application demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and allows hospital staff to efficiently manage patient records.

💡 OOP Concepts Implemented
1.	Abstraction: Person is an abstract class.
2.	Inheritance: Patient class extends Person.
3.	Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters and setters.
4.	Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding are used.

🛠️ Features
1.	➕ Add new patients with ID, name, age, and disease.
2.	📃 View a list of all patients.
3.	🔍 Search for a patient by ID.
4.	❌ Delete a patient record by ID.
5.	🧭 Interactive, console-based menu system.
